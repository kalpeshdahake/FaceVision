# FaceVision
:- This project focuses on face detection using computer vision techniques. It involves the use of Haar cascade classifiers and Dlib's frontal face detector to detect faces in images. The goal is to accurately locate and draw rectangles around the detected faces, enabling further analysis and applications in facial recognition and tracking.
